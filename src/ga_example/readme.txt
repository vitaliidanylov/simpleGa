Let's take a look at the classes we're going to create for our GA:
- Population - Manages all individuals of a population
- Individual - Manages an individuals
- Algorithm - Manages our evolution algorithms such as crossover and mutation
- FitnessCalc - Allows us set a candidate solution and calculate an individual's fitness
